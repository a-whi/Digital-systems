# ECE2072
Assignment work from my ECE2072 engineering class at university. (Digital Systems)             
Assignment 2022 is a pdf document explaining the assignment.

There are 3 parts to the assignment with the third part using the second parts module.    
The main aim for the assignment was to create a Cognition Timer with a Moore Finite State Machine which would give you two numbers and time how long it would take you to input the sum of the two numbers in binary. If wrong it would show an error is correct it would show you how long you took. 


There were modules provided to us in the assignment to help us with the task.
